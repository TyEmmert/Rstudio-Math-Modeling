# Math Projects
These are projects that I created for myself.

Craps - Game: A simulation of playing the game "Craps" in R. craps() plays the game and tells you whether you win or lose. cleancraps() is the same game, but without print commands. I replicated cleancraps() and simulated the percent chance to win.

Inflation - Graph displaying inflation for 2022. It covers months from Jan - Nov. The CPI indexes cover Gas, Food, and Energy for the entire US. Picture for final result.
