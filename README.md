# Math Projects
These are projects that I created for myself.

Craps - Game: A simulation of playing the game "Craps" in R. craps() plays the game and tells you whether you win or lose. cleancraps() is the same game, but without print commands. I replicated cleancraps() and simulated the percent chance to win.
